## Solution1 (sliding window)
``` java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (s == null || p == null || s.length() == 0 || p.length() == 0) {
            return res;
        }
        int[] freq = new int[256];
        for (Character c : p.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c]++;
        }
        int count = p.length(), left = 0, right = 0;
        while (right < s.length()) {
            if (freq[s.charAt(right)] >= 1) {
                count--;
            }
            freq[s.charAt(right)]--;
            right++;
            if (right - left == p.length()) {
                if (count == 0) {
                    res.add(left);
                }
                if (freq[s.charAt(left)] >= 0) {
                    count++;
                }
                freq[s.charAt(left)]++;
                left++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* Sliding window approach. The idea is to first store the frequency of each letter in string p into our freq array. Then, 
create two pointers left and right, with the right pointer moves first and left pointer moves afterwards and keep adjusting its
relative position to the right pointer (which looks like a sliding window). We will also include a count variable to keep track
of how many required characters have been found in our substring. When checking on right pointer, we only decrement count
if the frequency of character at right pointer<strong> >= 1 </strong>. When checking on left pointer, we only increment count if the frequency of
character at left pointer<strong> >= 0 </strong>.
