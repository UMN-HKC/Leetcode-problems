## Solution1 (one pass)
``` java
class Solution {
    public int minAddToMakeValid(String S) {
        if (S == null || S.length() == 0)   return 0;
        int add = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            if (S.charAt(i) != '(' && S.charAt(i) != ')')  continue;
            if (S.charAt(i) == ')') {   
                if (count <= 0) { 
                    add++;
                }
                else {
                    count--;
                }
            }
            else {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return add + count;
    }
}
```

## note
* time O(n) space O(1)
* The idea is simple and we only need to iterate through the string once.
We have 3 situations:
1). Character is not '(' or ')', we simply skip it. </br>
2). ')'. If it is closing bracket, we check the current count. If the count is less than or equal to 0, it means we must have
equal or more closing brackets at this point of traversal. So if we add the current closing bracket, we need to add an open 
bracket to balance it (make the whole string valid). If count is greater than 0, it means we have more open brackets at this 
point, we add this closing bracket, we subtract 1 from count.</br>
3). '('. If it is open bracket, we add 1 to count.</br>
Finally, add + count is the minimum brackets we need to add to the string to make it valid, because during traversal, the 
operation is minimal each time.
