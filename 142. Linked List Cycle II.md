## Solution1:
``` java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy;
        ListNode slow = fast;
        fast = getMeetingNode(dummy, fast, slow);
        
        if (fast == null) return null;
        
        slow = dummy;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        return slow;
        
    }
    private ListNode getMeetingNode(ListNode dummy, ListNode fast, ListNode slow) {
        
        while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            if (fast == slow) {
                return fast;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

## notes
* The simple math behind this problem which makes it possible for time O(n) and space O(1)
use two pointers, one moves 1 step and the other one moves 2 steps each time. if there's a cycle, they will meet 
eventually. Say, the slow pointer moves k steps when they meet, the fast pointer moves 2k steps and they meet at
the node within the loop. These two pointers' position is k from the start of the list and k = rn 
(r: representing integer no of loops/ n: number of nodes in this loop). Let's make n = 1 for now (n could be more than 1
but it doesn't change our result). If we roll the loop straight, it is obvious that where the two pointers meet 
overlaps with the starting point of the list. So, we move one pointer back to the starting point and keep the other still. 
This time, move both pointers 1 step at a time, the node they meet is the entry node.
