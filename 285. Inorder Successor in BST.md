``` java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        TreeNode succ = null;
        while (root != null) {
            if (root.val > p.val) {
                succ = root;
                root = root.left;
            }
            else {
                root = root.right;
            }
        }
        return succ;
    }
}
```

## note
* Since it's a bst, we can sort of do like a binary search on the bst. If the root value is greater than the node we 
are given, we search the left subtree and update the successor pointer to the root since it could potentially be the 
successor. Otherwise, we just move the root pointer to its right subtree and maintain the current successor (not changing).
