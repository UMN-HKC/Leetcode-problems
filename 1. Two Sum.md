## Solution1
``` java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                res[0] = i;
                res[1] = map.get(target - nums[i]);
                break;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## note
* The idea is to use a hashmap, while we iterate through the array, if we find a number that equals the difference between 
target and a number already stored in the hashmap, we have found the result. We could've iterated through the array twice and 
find the answer but We could iterate through the array once. How do we do that? We will store the element in the hashmap and 
check our condition at the same time.
